<instruction-prompt id="Evaluation">
<main-instruction>
You are an expert evaluator for tiny language models trained on children's stories. Your task is to score the given model completion (generated using the provided prompt) using the rubric below. Provide a detailed assessment followed by a final total score.
</main-instruction>

<additional-instructions>
<penalization-rule>
Penalize the following issues by decreasing one scoring level (1.0→0.5 or 0.5→0.0):

- Text repetition (words or phrases)
- Presence of <|endoftext|> token and/or start of a new story
</penalization-rule>

<evaluation-focus>
Do not evaluate any other aspect of the story other than the specific criterion being assessed.

<prompt-continuation>
Remember that the completion is a continuation of the prompt, not a standalone text.

<criteria>
<criterion id="A"></criterion>

</scoring-scale>

<scoring-instructions>
For each criterion A-E, assign a score of 1.0, 0.5, or 0.0 based on how well the completion satisfies that criterion. The final score is the sum of all criterion scores.

Provide your assessment of each criterion with specific examples from the text, then calculate the final score (sum of all criterion scores).

Format your response as:
