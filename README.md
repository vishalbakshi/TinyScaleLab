# TinyScaleLab
Bridging training dynamics and language capabilities for tiny models trained on the TinyStories dataset.

## LLM Judge Agreement on Evals

See my [LLM Judge prompt template](https://github.com/vishalbakshi/TinyScaleLab/blob/main/llm_judge_prompt_template.txt). Each scoring category (Grammar, Context-Tracking, Creativity, Factual Knowledge, Reasoning, and Plot) are evaluated with a separate prompt with [their own criteria](https://github.com/vishalbakshi/TinyScaleLab/blob/main/criteria.csv). See my [video for more context](https://youtu.be/FXOXoaGjntc).


### Overall

I agree with 94% of my Haiku LLM Judge's 1350 scores across 18 criteria for story completions generated by the existing TinyStories-1M/8M/33M models. This establishes my baseline comparison for future trained models.

### Agreement by Scoring Category

|Category|Agreement|
|:-:|:-:|
|Context-Tracking|92%|
|Creativity|95%
|Factual Knowledge|96%
|Grammar|90%
|Plot|99%
|Reasoning|89%

### Agreement by Scoring Criteria

The following tables show the percentage agreement between me and the Haiku-3.5 scores across scoring categories and criteria.


#### Grammar

|Criteria|Agreement|
|:-:|:-:|
|Age-appropriate vocabuary usage|83%
|Proper use of pronouns and referants|93%
|Sentence structure logic, clarity and completion|99%
|Tense consistency throughout the completion|84%

#### Context-Tracking

|Criteria|Agreement|
|:-:|:-:|
|Completion maintains complete coherence with prompt|92%

#### Factual Knowledge

|Criteria|Agreement|
|:-:|:-:|
|Completion contains only correct factual information relevant to the prompt|96%

#### Reasoning

|Criteria|Agreement|
|:-:|:-:|
|Completion demonstrates correct logical reasoning relevant to the prompt|89%

#### Creativity

|Criteria|Agreement|
|:-:|:-:|
|The completion contains unique details to the story world|95%
|The completion creates fresh situations|95%
|The completion offers unexpected or novel elements|96%

#### Plot

|Criteria|Agreement|
|:-:|:-:|
|Conflicts are addressed rather than abandoned|99%
|The pacing is appropriate (not too rushed or dragging)|99%
|The story has a clear beginning, middle, and end appropriate to age level|99%
|The story maintains focus on the central conflict/theme without random diversions|100%
|Maintains consistent narrative flow|99%
